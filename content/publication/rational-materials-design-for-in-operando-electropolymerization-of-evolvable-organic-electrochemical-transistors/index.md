abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors formed by in operando
  electropolymerization of the semiconducting channel are increasingly becoming
  recognized as a simple and effective implementation of synapses in
  neuromorphic hardware. However, very few studies have reported the
  requirements that must be met to ensure that the polymer spreads along the
  substrate to form a functional conducting channel. The nature of the interface
  between the substrate and various monomer precursors of conducting polymers
  through molecular dynamics simulations is investigated, showing that monomer
  adsorption to the substrate produces an increase in the effective monomer
  concentration at the surface. By evaluating combinatorial couples of monomers
  baring various sidechains with differently functionalized substrates, it is
  shown that the interactions between the substrate and the monomer precursor
  control the lateral growth of a polymer film along an inert substrate. This
  effect has implications for fabricating synaptic systems on inexpensive,
  flexible substrates.
